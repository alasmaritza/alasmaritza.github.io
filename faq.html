                        El Salvador has suffered from a tremendous resource drain caused by the country’s civil war (1980-1992), natural disasters,
                        and a lack of economic development. El Salvador’s primary export and cash crop, coffee, was seriously
                        affected by the Civil War and by the drop in world coffee prices. Hurricane Mitch hit El Salvador
                        in late October 1998, generating extreme rainfall of which caused widespread flooding and landslides.
                        Roughly 250 square miles were flooded, and 374 people were either killed or missing. Reconstruction
                        from Mitch was still underway when in January and February 2001 the country experienced two devastating
                        earthquakes that left nearly 2,000 people dead or missing, 8,000 injured, and caused severe dislocations
                        across every department of El Salvador. Nearly 25% of all private homes in the country were either
                        destroyed or badly damaged, and 1.5 million persons were left without housing. High levels of unemployment
                        and the privatization of many public services such as health and education have contributed to economic
                        hardships. Nearly one quarter of El Salvadorans live on less than $1 per day and over half live on
                        less than $2 per day.

                        <p>You can find an abundance of scriptures concerning missions and serving those in need. At the center
                            of this is of course is the great commission found in the final chapter of the gospel of Matthew.
                            One of my favorite verses is from Paul’s letter to Philippi, the second chapter verses 1-4 (MSG):</p>
                        <blockquote>If you’ve gotten anything at all out of following Christ, if his love has made any difference in
                            your life, if being in a community of the Spirit means anything to you, if you have a heart,
                            if you care -
                            <br>then do me a favor: Agree with each other, love each other, be deep-spirited friends.
                            <br> Don’t push your way to the front, don’t sweet-talk your way to the top. Put yourself aside,
                            and help others get ahead.
                            <br>Don’t be obsessed with getting you own advantage. Forget yourselves long enough to lend a helping
                            hand.</blockquote>
                        <p>As a member of a short term mission group we feel that it is important that before you come you spend
                            time praying and studying your personal meaning of Christian service. We think this will make
                            a significant difference in your mission experience here in El Salvador as well as your faith
                            walk in general.</p>

                        <p>Violence directed towards tourists is very rare. However, El Salvador has been classified as one
                            of the most violent countries in Latin America. Levels of violence in large cities is high, particularly
                            among young people who have few opportunities for employment and are drawn into local gangs.
                            We only allow teams to work in places that we are familiar with and that we feel are safe. It
                            is still a good idea, as it is whenever you are in an unfamiliar place, to stay aware of your
                            surroundings and be discreet when out and about. Your safety is our top priority and while we
                            cannot make any promises or guarantees, we will do our very best to make sure that while you
                            are in El Salvador that your work team is as safe and comfortable as possible. </p>

                            will also have some varying impact on the costs. If you team works in Ahuachapan the cost for
                            food, lodging, and transportation will be between $47 and $60 per person, per day. In addition
                            we request that each team also bring $400 for coordination consideration to cover expenses associated
                            with hosting your team. The costs for each project is as follows:</p>

                                etc. the cost is $20 per day per translator. If your team is working in San Salvador we can
                                provide a couple of options to try to work within your budget. Each mission team’s cost will
                                vary depending on projects, location, team size, plane tickets, and the number of team members.
                                Once we know you are coming, what you will be doing and staying we can give you a better
