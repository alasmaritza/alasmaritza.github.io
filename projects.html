                    Churches are built out of concrete block and include a sanctuary and classrooms for Sunday School and church activities.
                    We ask each team to bring $4,000 for church construction which cover materials and professional local
                    labor.

                    We construct simple homes of concrete block for families who own property but either live in overcrowded or sub-standard
                    conditions. The homes built by SMP are simple 36 square meter homes built from a government approved
                    plan. Houses are built for both church members and non church members. There is an application and review
                    process to ensure that the families being serviced can not obtain a home through any other means. The
                    cost to build a home is $5,300 which covers the cost of materials and local professional labor.

                    There is no shortage of children in El Salvador and they are an important part of SMP's ministry. All teams are welcome to
                    do bible school while working in El Salvador. Children go school half days (either in the morning or
                    the afternoon) so any time of year is ideal to have bible school. Teams will need to provide their own
                    material and supplies. If you need to have a translator for your bible school let us know and we can
                    line that up.

                    We host medical teams and arrange for them to set up mobile clinics in impoverished communities and provide medical services
                    for free. Medical teams are responsible for providing their own supplies and medicines. The process for
                    getting permits for medications to enter El Salvador is lengthy. Paperwork must be filed 90 days prior
                    to your arrival in order to make sure there is no problems at customs. Additionally the Methodist Church
                    in El Salvador maintains a Methodist Medical Clinic in Ahuachapan and provides facilities for government
                    doctors in La Providencia. The Methodist Clinic seeks to help people who are in need of medical services
                    but that do not have the resources to pay to be seen at a traditionally staffed clinic in El Salvador.
                    The Methodist clinic only charges $5.00 and medicines are always dispensed free of charge. The clinic
                    is always in need of medicines please let us know if you or your church would like to help keep the pharmacy
                    stocked and we will send you the information you need.

                    Using funds brought by your team we will purchase staple dry goods that the team will repackage into large plastic bags.
                    Your team then distributes the food in small groups to families in communities that we are familiar with.
                    The food bags are distributed in the form of a home visit so that the team members will get a chance
                    to talk and pray with the families that are receiving the food as well as invite them to worship with
                    us. We ask the teams participating in this ministry bring $1,000 to purchase the food that you will be
                    distributing. Any bags that your team does not distribute are put into the church's food bank for distribution
                    by Methodist churches throughout El Salvador.
